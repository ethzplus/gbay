<p><div CLASS=desc><p>The current case (i.e., findings entered) is used to revise each node's conditional probabilities.  This is different from <i>belief updating</i>, which finds the beliefs for nodes (i.e., posterior probabilities), given conditional probability relations between them and the findings that have been entered.  Instead, <i>revising</i> the probabilities changes the conditional probability tables (CPTs) between the nodes to account for the current case.
<p>The first few times this is called for a node, the probabilities will change considerably, because the node has little experience, but after many cases have been entered, each new case will result in only a small change.
<p>All the nodes of <span CLASS="paramNm">nodes</span> must be in the same net. 

<p>Pass 0 for <span CLASS="paramNm">updating</span>.  It is only for future expansion.
<p><span CLASS="paramNm">degree</span> indicates how the case should be weighted.  The normal value for <span CLASS="paramNm">degree</span> is 1.  If a positive integer n is passed, it will have the same effect as calling this function n times to tally up n identical cases.  If <span CLASS="paramNm">degree</span> is 0, the call will have no effect.  If the case is learned by calling with <span CLASS="paramNm">degree</span> = 1, it can later be "unlearned" by calling with <span CLASS="paramNm">degree</span> = -1.
<p>In general, if it is called with <span CLASS="paramNm">degree</span> = d at one point in time, and then with the same case and <span CLASS="paramNm">degree</span> = c at another time, the overall effect will be the same as a single call with <span CLASS="paramNm">degree</span> = d + c, even if there were many intervening calls with other cases and other degrees, and even if d or c or both are negative.  If a call to <a href="FadeCPTable_bn.html">FadeCPTable_bn</a> was made in between, then d will be weighted by the degree passed to <a href="FadeCPTable_bn.html">FadeCPTable_bn</a>.
<p>The order in which cases are presented has no effect.
<p>If a node already has CPT and experience tables, this function uses the experience table to provide a "confidence" for each of the probabilities in the CPT table.  The higher the experience of a probability, the less it will be altered.  It is okay if a node starts with no CPT or experience tables, since then Netica will start it off with a uniform distribution having the minimum experience.  However, when calling this function, a node cannot have a CPT table and no experience table, since then Netica will not know what confidence to assign the existing probabilities of the CPT table, and an error will be generated.
<p><b>NOTE:</b> If there are nodes without CPTs in <span CLASS="paramNm">nodes</span> for which there are no findings (or there is no information on one of their parents), they will not be modified, so no CPT table will be built, so a later call to <a href="GetNodeProbs_bn.html">GetNodeProbs_bn</a> could return <span CLASS="reservedWord">NULL</span> unexpectedly.</div>
