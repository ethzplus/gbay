Note that not all releases were made publicly available.

5.04  2012-01-21
- Many major speed improvments, especially when operating in a multi-threaded environment.
- Further improvements to time-series net and dynamic bayes net (DBN) capability 
  (e.g. titles of nodes are now augmented with their point in time during expansion).
- Improved or added functions ExpandNet_bn, SetNodeInputDelay_bn, SetNodePersistance_bn, GetNodeAtTime_bn.
- Can enter "action values" to nodes, which follow semantics of Pearl's do-calculus.  
  Added functions: EnterAction_bn, EnterActionValue_bn, EnterActionRandomized_bn
- Major improvements to GenerateRandomCase_bn (including using some determinstic forward propagation for continuous real values), and fixing some bugs:
    Generating a random case by forward sampling didnt work right if there was a CPT with UNDEF_PROB, where the whole row wasnt UNDEF_PROB
    Generating a random case by join tree could fail with an error #2078
- Major upgrade to callback system in speed and functionality.  
  One result is that when nodes and nets are duplicated, now their listeners are duplicated as well.
- Added function RetractFindingsOfNodes to NeticaEx.
- Improved reading values from case files and its error reporting.  
  Now handles ">70" if there is a discrete node with the state title ">70" (earlier it tried to interpret that as a UVF value)
- Fixed problem in the way versions 5.02 and 5.03 saved printer settings to file, that made it not readable by older versions of Netica (example 4.16).
- Expanded on the 'options' parameter for CopyNet_bn, CopyNodes_bn, which can control what gets copied.
	
5.03  2011-08-11
- When entering a calibration finding that conflicts with the finding already at the node, now removes the original finding first.
- Can now learn from cases when starting with no CPT supplied, but experience value supplied (table with all entries the same).
- While EM learning from a case file having a case inconsistent with the Bayes net, now puts the IDnum of the case in the error message.

5.02  2011-04-09
- Fixed a memory leak which occured (only) when reversing links in a net with visual information.
- GetStateNamed_bn couldn't handle NULL for 'name'
- Major improvements to time-series net and dynamic bayes net (DBN) capability.  
  Expand net now takes a burn-in time to generate initial-state nodes, etc.  
- Improved Netica's architecture for pseudo-random operations, and made it possible to act deterministically under multi-threading
- Added the random funcs: NewRandomGenerator_ns, DeleteRandomGen_ns, SetNetRandomGen_bn, GetRandomGenState_ns, GenerateRandomNumbers_ns.  
  GenerateRandomCase_bn now takes a randgen_ns.
- Added ControlConcurrency_ns, and made all of Netica able to concurrently run Bayes nets in separate threads if desired.
